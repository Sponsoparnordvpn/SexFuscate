# SexFuscate 1.0.0

Welcome to SexFuscate, a Luau uglifier made in Luau.

**WARNING: SexFuscate is a source-based obfuscator, which means that we do source-based obfuscation and not VM-based obfuscation.**

**Note:** I made this for learning purposes; feel free to use it to fit your needs!

## Introduction
SexFuscate is a tool designed to obfuscate Luau code by transforming the source code into a less readable format while maintaining its functionality. This can help in protecting your scripts from being easily read or modified by others.

## Installation
To install SexFuscate, simply clone the repository from GitHub and require it in your project.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Sponsoparnordvpn/SexFuscate.git
```

## Usage
To run SexFuscate, please head up to .vscode/main.luau. You'll find the configuration here. Then scroll down at the bottom and you'll find the "source" variable, just put your code here.
