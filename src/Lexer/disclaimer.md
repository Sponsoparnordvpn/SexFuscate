## Origin and Modifications

This project is a derivative of the [LuauLexer](https://github.com/astriaInight/LuauLexer/tree/main), with significant modifications tailored to specific needs:

### Modifications
- Enhanced lexer to support table indexing (`game.HttpGet`) through added patterns:
  - `methodcall`
  - `tableaccess`
- Expanded parsing capabilities with new keywords:
  - `do`
  - `return`

### Acknowledgement

**Note:** The original lexer was developed by others. I've customized it to meet my requirements.
